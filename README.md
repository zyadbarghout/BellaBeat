Approaching this dataset I wanted to put on the user's shoes and live his journey day by day, so the classification here will be according to the weekdays and the hours


Plotting the average steps against the weekdays it was obvious that the users are most active at the Saturdays and Tuesdays and least active at the Lazy Sundays

While this was a great insight it reamined unclear when were the users most active among these days and what is the reasoning behind it?

Asking such a question took me to analyze the daily life routine of the users through their steps daily in which it was found that:
The users are most active between 5 pm to 7 pm and also at 12 pm, well great you can recognize there that 5 to 7 are the hours when employees finish their working day so that is logical
and also at 12 pm as this would be the lunch break

Great! but still we need to go the extra mile here and both validate our hypothesis and search for more insights

So, I went through the steps distribution daily by hours to find that the working days had the 5 to 7 spikes while it was absent in the Saturdays and Sundays confirming our hypothesis there

Following this we needed to study further the users' behaviors and their activities according to both minutes and distance
So we found out that the most of the time the users' are spending their time mostly sedentary and when they are doing activities it is mostly light ones

and then when plotting the distance of each activity the light activities were the highest normally as they had the highest minutes and then the very active minutes which came second

So now we have an understanding of the users and now we know how to approach them according to these information
